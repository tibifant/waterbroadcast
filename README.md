# Water Broadcast  
*Take care of your friends plant, even when miles apart.*  

## üìå Overview  

The project "Water Broadcast" is a product of our IoT course with Matthias B√∂hmer and introduces a new way of connecting friends across distances.

We were given the task to bridge the gap in friendships and quickly decided that our favorite way of connecting is through acts of service or kindness.
Given that we‚Äôve all sadly lost beloved plants due to negligence before, we decided to tackle that problem by creating a friendship-based watering system.
Instead of sending a long message or making a time-consuming call, you can simply go about your day and water your friend‚Äôs plant by watering your own. Whether you live in different parts of a city or thousands of miles apart, a simple favor can make you feel deeply connected.
We often pressure ourselves about not being able to fulfill all our social duties and expectations after a long day. What if staying connected doesn‚Äôt require additional effort but instead minimizes it by sharing a chore with a friend?

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With  
- **Technologies:** [C++, Node Red]  
- **Tools:** [CLion, PlatformIO, Git, Arduino Libary, RTOS, MQTT]  
- **Hardware:** [Esp32 Dev Module, two pumps, two tubes, cables, two transistors, Esp power cable, two 1K resistors, two Moisture Sensors]  

## üöÄ Getting Started  
### Prerequisites  
- List software/tools users need installed (`C++`, `CLion`/ or Alternative eg. VS Code,`PlatformIO`extension within IDE ).  
- Hardware components (Your Laptop must have a fitting port/ Adapter to connected to your ESP32).  

### Installation & Setup  
1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   cd [project-folder]
   git clone [the-repo-url.git] or via SSH-Key
   
2. Now redirect to the IDE of you choice and open the project.

## Would you like to build our project yourself to connect with a longdistance friend?
